I have [read][1] about [Solarized][2] recently. It is a sixteen color palette designed for use with terminal and gui applications. I am using both the dark and light mode in [Gnome Terminal][3], [vim][4] and [Netbeans][5] since a few days and I really like to work with it and do not want to miss it.
