I cannot open some SSL-encrypted websites (https) in Firefox right now. I have found out that this is caused by the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) which confirms the current validity of certificates. All those websites are using certificates issued by [cacert.org][1] and their OCSP server (ocsp.cacert.org) is currently quiet busy (“Too many users” or timeouts).

 [1]: http://cacert.org

Quick workaround is to temporarily disable OCSP in Firefox (or other affected web browsers). You can uncheck this feature in Preferences → Advanced → Encryption → Validation in Firefox.

**Update:** Server seems to be working again.
